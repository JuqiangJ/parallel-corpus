The Parallel Audiobook Corpus (version 1.0) is a collection of parallel readings of audiobooks. The corpus consists of approximately **121 hours of data** across 4 books and 59 speakers.

The key difference with respect to similar databases is the parallel nature of the data. The same textual source is read separately by multiple speakers.

Audio data is extracted from LibriVox: https://librivox.org

Textual data is taken from Project Gutenberg: https://www.gutenberg.org
